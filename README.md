# Circular List Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a Circular List data structure in C++, along with a demonstration of its usage.

## Overview

A Circular List is a linked list where the last node points back to the first node, creating a circular structure. This implementation provides functionalities to insert, delete, search, and manipulate elements in the list efficiently.

## Features

- Insertion and deletion operations
- Circular traversal and manipulation
- Search operations
- Memory management

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/circular-list.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the cloned directory:
     ```
     cd circular-list
     ```

2. **Build the Project:**
   - Ensure Make is installed on your system.
   - Run the Makefile to build the project:
     ```
     make
     ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the compiled program:
     ```
     ./cList > cListOutput.txt
     ```
   - This command generates the output in a text file named `cListOutput.txt`.

4. **View the Output:**
   - Open `cListOutput.txt` to view the program output.

5. **Clean Up:**
   - To remove compiled files, run:
     ```
     make clean
     ```
